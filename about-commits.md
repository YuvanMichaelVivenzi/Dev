This file is about my lackluster committment to doing stuff on this repository.. 
I haven't been doing much over here to be honest. Although I promised to actually update this repo upon my progress. The project has come to a point where, I keep getting reminded to do something. As I had highlighted this repo in my mind as a accountability factor so that I see real progress on my coding and programming skills. 
I got into a college that's a little different from your regular one, I'm being made to code there, sadly, I get a lot of stuff to do and college takes up most of my day along with my natural youtube video watching and gaming, after a day's work. 
So, all my progress is saved on a college-made learning portal instead of being on this github repo. 
But, for the things I do in college, and I wanna keep seperate from my gigs, I made a new folder here. called NIAT, which is my college's name. 
Over the years that I'm in this college, I'll commit more and more into both NIAT and the Dev repo. Chances are that I might not do that at times, even for up to a week. But I will. I'm planning to make a whole lot of projects, including making stuff like my own website, self-made games, etc. I think those results will speak more prominently than me committing regularly to the repo. 

A few of the goals I'd like to acheive by 4 years or so/ 
1. Get a nice looking website for myself. Literally about me, hosted on GitHub. 
2. Improve my GitHub account and repos. 
3. Get a job. 
4. Keep making amazing projects. 


For those who might want an update on my dotfiles, I'm looking on ways on how to make it even better. I think the configs are slightly out of date now, I'll update soon. Just got a Mac for college, have VMware Fusion for running operating systems. My arch dots will have to be developed inside that virtual environment.
