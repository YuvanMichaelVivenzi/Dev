# Dev
All my dev work, I'm learning how to code. This repository contains resources that are publicly available on sites like YouTube, MDN Web Docs, Wikipedia, etc.

# Hello!
This is my personal development project, where I can keep track of my progress on learning all the various programming languages out there. (Or, atleast the ones that I find myself to be curious about.)

### Stuff I'm currently into. 
1. Web Development (Full Stack) (HTML, CSS, JS + Other frameworks like React, Angular, next.js, etc)
2. Python (It's a popular one that's pretty easy to get started with)
3. Rust (Not started yet, I wanna learn C first, so that I can appreciate all the features that this language provides over C). 
4. C, C#, C++ etc (Generally regarded as a great foundation on learning to code )


#### Why am I doing this on GitHub?
1. Accountability. 
2. Having stuff in one place. 
3. Code backups
4. Testing
5. Master Git. 
6. Valuable resource that'll surely be useful for others and any projects I make or get into. 
7. Memory Lanes.
