# Hello!
This is my personal development project, where I can keep track of my progress on learning all the various programming languages out there. (Or, atleast the ones that I find myself to be curious about.)

### Stuff I'm currently into. 
1. Web Development (Full Stack) (HTML, CSS, JS + Other frameworks like React, Angular, next.js, etc)
2. Python (It's a popular one that's pretty easy to get started with)
3. Rust
4. C++ 
5. Swift


#### Why am I doing this on GitHub?
1. Accountability. 
2. Having stuff in one place. 
3. Code backups
4. Testing
5. Master Git. 
6. Valuable resource that'll surely be useful for others and any projects I make or get into. 
7. Memory Lanes.
